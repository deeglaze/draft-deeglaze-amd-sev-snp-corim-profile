       RTP allows multiple RTP streams to be sent in a single session, but
      requires each Synchronisation Source (SSRC) to send RTCP reception
      quality reports for every other SSRC visible in the session. This causes
      the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number of SSRCs,
      rather than the number of endpoints. In many cases most of these RTCP
      reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an endpoint are
      normally co-located and see the same reception quality. This memo
      defines a Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the reporting
      overhead in such scenarios.

<p id="section-1-1">The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <span>[<a href="#RFC3550" class="xref">RFC3550</a>]</span> is a
      protocol for group communication, supporting multiparty multimedia
      sessions. A single RTP session can support multiple participants sending
      at once, and can also support participants sending multiple simultaneous
      RTP streams. Examples of the latter might include a participant with
      multiple cameras who chooses to send multiple views of a scene, or a
      participant that sends audio and video flows multiplexed in a single RTP
      session. Rules for handling RTP sessions containing multiple RTP streams
      are described in <span>[<a href="#RFC3550" class="xref">RFC3550</a>]</span> with some clarifications in
      <span>[<a href="#RTP-STREAMS" class="xref">RTP-STREAMS</a>]</span>.<a href="#section-1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-2">An RTP endpoint will have one or more synchronisation sources
      (SSRCs). It will have at least one RTP Stream, and thus SSRC, for each
      media source it sends, and might use multiple SSRCs per media source
      when using <span><a href="#RFC6190" class="xref">media scalability features</a> [<a href="#RFC6190" class="xref">RFC6190</a>]</span>,
      forward error correction, <span><a href="#RFC4588" class="xref">RTP
      retransmission</a> [<a href="#RFC4588" class="xref">RFC4588</a>]</span>, or similar mechanisms. An endpoint that is not
      sending any RTP stream, will have at least one SSRC to use for reporting
      and any feedback messages. Each SSRC has to send RTCP sender reports
      corresponding to the RTP packets it sends, and receiver reports for
      traffic it receives. That is, every SSRC will send RTCP packets to
      report on every other SSRC. This rule is simple, but can be quite
      inefficient for endpoints that send large numbers of RTP streams in a
      single RTP session. Consider a session comprising ten participants, each
      sending three media sources, each with their own RTP stream. There will
      be 30 SSRCs in such an RTP session, and each of those 30 SSRCs will send
      an RTCP Sender Report/Receiver Report packet (containing several report
      blocks) per reporting interval as each SSRC reports on all the others.
      However, the three SSRCs comprising each participant are commonly
      co-located such that they see identical reception quality. If there was
      a way to indicate that several SSRCs are co-located, and see the same
      reception quality, then two-thirds of those RTCP reports could be
      suppressed. This would allow the remaining RTCP reports to be sent more
      often, while keeping within the same RTCP bandwidth fraction.<a href="#section-1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-1-3">This memo defines such an RTCP extension, RTCP Reporting Groups. This
      extension is used to indicate the SSRCs that originate from the same
      endpoint, and therefore have identical reception quality, hence allowing
      the endpoints to suppress unnecessary RTCP reception quality
      reports.<a href="#section-1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-3-1">An RTCP Reporting Group is a set of synchronization sources (SSRCs)
      that are co-located at a single endpoint (which could be an end host or
      a middlebox) in an RTP session. Since they are co-located, every SSRC in
      the RTCP reporting group will have an identical view of the network

        allows SSRCs to send rapid RTCP feedback requests and codec control

<p id="section-3.3-2">The members of an RTCP reporting group will all see identical
        network conditions. Accordingly, one might therefore think that it
        doesn't matter which SSRC in the reporting group sends the RTP/AVPF
        feedback or codec control messages. There might be, however, cases
        where the sender of the feedback/codec control message has semantic
        importance, or when only a subset of the members of an RTCP reporting
        group might want to send RTP/AVPF feedback or a codec control message
        in response to a particular event. For example, an RTP video sender
        might choose to treat packet loss feedback received from SSRCs known
        to be audio receivers with less urgency than feedback that it receives
        from video receivers when deciding what packets to retransmit, and a
        multimedia receiver using reporting groups might want to choose the
        outgoing SSRC for feedback packets to reflect this.<a href="#section-3.3-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-3">Each member of an RTCP reporting group <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> therefore send
        RTP/AVPF feedback/codec control messages independently of the other
        members of the reporting group, to respect the semantic meaning of the
        message sender. The suppression rules of <span>[<a href="#RFC4585" class="xref">RFC4585</a>]</span> will
        ensure that only a single copy of each feedback packet is (typically)
        generated, even if several members of a reporting group send the same
        feedback. When an endpoint knows that several members of its RTCP
        reporting group will be sending identical feedback, and that the
        sender of the feedback is not semantically important, then that
        endpoint <span class="bcp14">MAY</span> choose to send all its feedback from the reporting source
        and deterministically suppress feedback packets generated by the other
        sources in the reporting group.<a href="#section-3.3-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-4">It is important to note that the RTP/AVPF timing rules operate on a
        per-SSRC basis. Using a single reporting source to send all feedback
        for a reporting group will hence limit the amount of feedback that can
        be sent to that which can be sent by one SSRC. If this limit is a
        problem, then the reporting group can allow each of its members to
        send its own feedback, using its own SSRC.<a href="#section-3.3-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.3-5">If the RTP/AVPF feedback messages or codec control requests are

        include either an RTCP RGRS packet or an RTCP SDES RGRP item,
        depending on whether they are sent by the reporting source or a
        non-reporting source in the RTCP reporting group respectively. The

        value as the measuring intervals are not synchronized in those
        cases.<a href="#section-3.4-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-3.4-2">Some RTCP XR report blocks are specific to particular types of
        media, and might be relevant to only some members of a reporting
        group. For example, it would make no sense for an SSRC that is
        receiving video to send a VoIP metric RTCP XR report block. Such media
        specific RTCP XR report blocks <span class="bcp14">MUST</span> be sent by the SSRC to which they
        are relevant, and <span class="bcp14">MUST NOT</span> be included in the common report sent by
        the reporting source. This might mean that some SSRCs send RTCP XR
        packets in compound RTCP packets that contain an empty RTCP SR/RR
        packet, and that the time period covered by the RTCP XR packet is
        different to that covered by the RTCP SR/RR packet. If it is important
        that the RTCP XR packet and RTCP SR/RR packet cover the same time
        period, then that source  <span class="bcp14">SHOULD</span> be removed from the RTCP reporting

        receive. RTP middleboxes that do not have their own SSRC, and that
        don't send RTCP reports on the traffic they receive, cannot use the

        for both audio and video flows that are multiplexed onto a single RTP
        session, where the middlebox has one SSRC for the audio mixer and one
        for the video mixer part, and when the middlebox wants to avoid cross

        </h3>
<p id="section-4.1-1">To understand the benefits of RTCP reporting groups, consider a
        scenario in which the two endpoints in a session each have a hundred
        sources, of which eight each are sending within any given reporting
        interval.<a href="#section-4.1-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1-2">For ease of analysis, we can make the simplifying approximation
        that the duration of the RTCP reporting interval is equal to the total
        size of the RTCP packets sent during an RTCP interval, divided by the
        RTCP bandwidth. (This will be approximately true in scenarios where
        the bandwidth is not so high that the minimum RTCP interval is
        reached.) For further simplification, we can assume RTCP senders are
        following the recommendations regarding Compound RTCP Packets in <span>[<a href="#RTP-STREAMS" class="xref">RTP-STREAMS</a>]</span>; thus, the per-packet
        transport-layer overhead will be small relative to the RTCP data.
        Thus, only the actual RTCP data itself need be considered.<a href="#section-4.1-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1-3">In a report interval in this scenario, there will, as a baseline,
        be 200 SDES packets, 184 RR packets, and 16 SR packets. This amounts
        to approximately 6.5 kB of RTCP per report interval, assuming 16-byte
        CNAMEs and no other SDES information.<a href="#section-4.1-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1-4">Using the original <span>[<a href="#RFC3550" class="xref">RFC3550</a>]</span>
        everyone-reports-on-every-sender feedback rules, each of the 184
        receivers will send 16 report blocks, and each of the 16 senders will
        send 15. This amounts to approximately 76 kB of report block traffic
        per interval; 92% of RTCP traffic consists of report blocks.<a href="#section-4.1-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.1-5">If reporting groups are used, however, there is only 0.4 kB of
        reports per interval, with no loss of useful information.
        Additionally, there will be (assuming 16-byte RGRPs, and a single
        reporting source per reporting group) an additional 2.4 kB per cycle
        of RGRP SDES items and RGRS packets. Put another way, the unmodified
        <span>[<a href="#RFC3550" class="xref">RFC3550</a>]</span> reporting interval is approximately 9 times
        longer than if reporting groups are in use.<a href="#section-4.1-5" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-4.2-1">The RTCP traffic generated by receivers using RTCP Reporting Groups
        might appear, to observers unaware of these semantics, to be generated
        by receivers who are experiencing a network disconnection, as the
        non-reporting sources appear not to be receiving a given sender at
        all.<a href="#section-4.2-1" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.2-2">This could be a potentially critical problem for such a sender
        using RTCP for congestion control, as such a sender might think that
        it is sending so much traffic that it is causing complete congestion
        collapse.<a href="#section-4.2-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-4.2-3">However, such an interpretation of the session statistics would
        require a fairly sophisticated RTCP analysis. Any receiver of RTCP
        statistics which is just interested in information about itself needs
        to be prepared that any given reception report might not contain
        information about a specific media source, because reception reports
        in large conferences can be round-robined.<a href="#section-4.2-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>

<p id="section-5-2">The RTCP SDES RGRP item is vulnerable to malicious modifications
      unless integrity protected is used. A modification of this item's length
      field cause the parsing of the RTCP packet in which it is contained to
      fail. Depending on the implementation, parsing of the full compound RTCP
      packet can also fail causing the whole packet to be discarded. A
      modification to the value of this SDES item would make the receiver of
      the report think that the sender of the report was a member of a
      different RTCP reporting group. This will potentially create an
      inconsistency, when the RGRS reports the source as being in the same
      reporting group as another source with another reporting group
      identifier. What impact on a receiver implementation such
      inconsistencies would have are difficult to fully predict. One case is
      when congestion control or other adaptation mechanisms are used, an
      inconsistent report can result in a media sender to reduce its bit-rate.
      However, a direct modification of the receiver report or a feedback
      message itself would be a more efficient attack, and equally costly to
      perform.<a href="#section-5-2" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-3">The new RGRS RTCP Packet type is very simple. The common RTCP packet

      implementation. Modification of the "List of SSRCs for the Reporting
      Source(s)" would change the SSRC the receiver expect to report on behalf
      of this SSRC. If that SSRC exist, that could potentially change the
      report group used for this SSRC. A change to another reporting group
      belonging to another endpoint is likely detectable as there would be a
      mismatch between the SSRC of the packet sender's endpoint information,
      transport addresses, SDES CNAME etc and the corresponding information
      from the reporting group indicated.<a href="#section-5-3" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-4">In general the reporting group is providing limited impacts attacks.
      The most significant result from an deliberate attack would be to cause
      the information to be discarded or be inconsistent, including discard of
      all RTCP packets that are modified. This causes a lack of information at
      any receiver entity, possibly disregarding the endpoints participation
      in the session.<a href="#section-5-4" class="pilcrow">¶</a></p>
<p id="section-5-5">To protect against this type of attacks from external non trusted
