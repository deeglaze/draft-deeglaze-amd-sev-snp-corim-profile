      "body": "I wonder if it makes sense for the Reference Values to include ALL the TCB versions that are typically available in an Attestation Report - such as CURRENT_TCB (mKey 6), REPORTED_TCB (mKey 647), COMMITTED_TCB (mKey 3329) and LAUNCH_TCB (mKey 3968).\n\nI'm of the view that it's sufficient to just include the REPORTED_TCB in the Reference Values.\n\nFor a short intro:\n- REPORTED_TCB is the TCB that is reported to the VM owner. This is the TCB version that is used to fetch VCEK.\n- CURRENT_TCB is the version of the latest TCB. It's purpose appears to be to inform the admin of the bare-metal/host to figure out what's the latest available TCB\n- COMMITTED_TCB is the anti-rollback version. The SP won't allow the admin to downgrade the TCB below this one\n- LAUNCH_TCB is the TCB with which the VM launched.\n\nI wonder what the verifier should do with each of these TCBs. Here's how I see the verifier handling the TCBs:\n- The verifier should confirm that the REPORTED_TCB in the attestation report should be equal to or greater than the REPORTED_TCB in the reference value\n- The policy engine could enforce that the LAUNCH_TCB in the report isn't lower than than the COMMITTED_TCB in the report. This is to ensure the VM was launched with all the required components\n\nSo, I'm unsure about the value of having CURRENT_TCB, COMMITTED_TCB and LAUNCH_TCB in the reference value. We should this another look. Thanks!",

Using `&(svn: 1)` for TCB doesn't appear useful, looks like `&(raw-value: 4)` would be a better fit. It's because TCB is not a single version, but is made up of multiple versions. So we can't compare one TCB as a whole with another, we need to extract the individual components and compare them individually.",
