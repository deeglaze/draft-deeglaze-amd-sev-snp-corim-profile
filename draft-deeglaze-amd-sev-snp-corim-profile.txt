1.  Introduction

   This profile describes the extensions and restrictions placed on
   Reference Values, Endorsements, and Evidence that support the
   attestation capabilities of AMD products that provide Securet
   Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Pages (SEV-SNP).

   CoRIM ([I-D.ietf-rats-corim]) defines a baseline CDDL for Reference
   Values and Endorsements that this profile extends.  Some measurement
   types of the baseline CDDL are not used in this profile.  The AMD
   SEV-SNP attestation report byte format is specified by AMD.  The
   profile defines a transformation from the AMD byte format into a
   CoMID representation for use in appraisal.

   This profile is meant for expressing reference values and
   endorsements of specific environments.  It is not meant to encode
   complex policy decisions about the acceptability of measurements.
   The accepted claim set construction (ACS) this profile enables does
   lay a foundation for policy engines that enable further evaluation
   over complete ACS constructions.

   This profile extends the flags-map to represent the guest policy and
   host platform info that are unique to AMD SEV-SNP.  This profile
   extends the $version-scheme enumeration to account for the FAMILY_ID
   and IMAGE_ID fields of the ID block.  The profile extends the
   $crypto-key-type-choice to represent the SHA-384 digest of a key in
   AMD format from Appendix: Digital Signatures of [SEV-SNP.API].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC2119 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-corim] and Section 4 of [RFC9334].  The syntax of data
   descriptions is CDDL as specified in [RFC8610].  Fields of the AMD
   SEV-SNP ATTESTATION_REPORT are referred to by their assigned names in
   [SEV-SNP.API].

3.  AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Reports

   The AMD SEV-SNP attestation scheme in [SEV-SNP.API] contains
   measurements of security-relevant configuration of the host
   environment and the launch configuration of a SEV-SNP VM.  This draft
   documents the normative representation of attestation report Evidence
   as a CoRIM profile.

   AMD-SP: AMD Secure Processor.  A separate core that provides the
   confidentiality and integrity properties of AMD SEV-SNP.  The
   function that is relevant to this document is its construction of
   signed virtual machine attestation reports.

   [VCEK]: Versioned Chip Endorsement Key.  A key for signing the SEV-
   SNP Attestation Report.  The key is derived from a unique device
   secret as well as the security patch levels of relevant host
   components.

   [VLEK]: Version Loaded Endorsement Key.  An alternative SEV-SNP
   Attestation Report signing key that is derived from a secret shared
   between AMD and a Cloud Service Provider.  The key is encrypted with
   a per-device per-version wrapping key that is then decrypted and
   stored by the AMD-SP.

   VEK: Either a VCEK or VLEK.

3.1.  AMD SEV-SNP CoRIM Profile

   AMD SEV-SNP launch endorsements are carried in one or more CoMIDs
   inside a CoRIM.

   The profile attribute in the CoRIM MUST be present and MUST have a
   single entry set to the URI http://amd.com/please-permalink-me as
   shown in Figure 1.

   / corim-map / {
     / corim.profile / 3: [
       32("http://amd.com/please-permalink-me")
     ]
     / ... /
   }

       Figure 1: SEV-SNP attestation profile version 1, CoRIM profile

3.1.1.  AMD SEV-SNP Target Environment

   The ATTESTATION_REPORT structure as understood in the RATS
   Architecture [RFC9334] is a signed collection of Claims that
   constitute Evidence about the Target Environment.  The Attester for
   the ATTESTATION_REPORT is specialized hardware that will only run
   AMD-signed firmware.

   The instance identifier can be argued as any of REPORT_ID,
   REPORT_ID_MA when non-zero, CHIP_ID (for VCEK), or CSP_ID (for VLEK).
   Given that REPORT_ID and REPORT_ID_MA are more ephemeral measured
   values and not the instance of the AMD-SP as the attesting
   environment, they are relegated to measurements.  Any endorsement of
   VM instances specific to either the REPORT_ID or REPORT_ID_MA values
   SHOULD use a conditional endorsement triple.

   The different notions of identity induce different classes of
   attestation to identify target environments.  The different classes
   of attestation are

   *  By chip: The environment-map / instance is 560(CHIP_ID).

   *  By CSP: The environment-map / instance is 560(CSP_ID).

   The class-id for the Target Environment measured by the AMD-SP is a
   tagged UUID that corresponds to the attestation class:

   *  By chip: d05e6d1b-9f46-4ae2-a610-ce3e6ee7e153

   *  By CSP: 89a7a1f0-e704-4faa-acbd-81c86df8a961

   TODO: AMD to assign OIDs for the above classes, e.g.,
   #6.111(1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.2.1) and #6.111(1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.2.2).  The
   rest of the class-map MUST remain empty, since class is compared for
   deterministic CBOR binary encoding equality.

   The group is free for a CoRIM issuer to assign.

   If the SIGNING_KEY bit of the attestation report is 1 indicating VLEK
   use, then the class-id MUST NOT be by chip.

   / environment-map / {
     / class-map / {
       / class-id: / 0 => #6.111(1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.2.1)
     }
     / instance: / 1 => #6.560(REPORT_ID)
   }

3.1.2.  AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Report measurements

   The fields of an attestation report are named by mkey numbers that
   map to appropriate measurement-values-map values.  This profile
   defines no new measurement-values-map extensions for the
   $$measurement-values-map-extensions socket.  The only extensions are
   to $$flags-map-extensions.

   The VMPL field is a raw 0..3 value, so this profile extends the raw
   value type choice of the CoRIM base CDDL:

   $raw-value-type-choice /= uint

3.1.2.1.  AMD SEV-SNP flags-map extensions

   The POLICY field and the PLATFORM_INFO field of the attestation
   report contain flags distinguished from the base CoRIM CDDL.

   The POLICY boolean flags are added as extensions to $$flags-map-
   extension, starting from codepoint -1.

   $$flags-map-extension //= &(
     sevsnpvm-policy-smt-allowed: -1,
     sevsnpvm-policy-migration-agent-allowed: -2,
     sevsnpvm-policy-debug-allowed: -3,
     sevsnpvm-policy-single-socket-only: -4,
     sevsnpvm-policy-cxl-allowed: -5,
     sevsnpvm-policy-mem-aes-256-xts-required: -6,
     sevsnpvm-policy-rapl-must-be-disabled: -7,
     sevsnpvm-policy-ciphertext-hiding-must-be-enabled: -8,
     sevsnpvm-policy-reserved: -47..-9,
   )

   The sevsnpvm-policy- flag extensions correspond to the
   ATTESTATION_REPORT POLICY bit positions with the following
   correspondence:

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-smt-allowed refers to bit 16 of POLICY.

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-migration-agent-allowed refers to bit 18 of
      POLICY.

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-debug-allowed refers to bit 19 of POLICY.

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-single-socket-only refers to bit 20 of POLICY.

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-cxl-allowed refers to bit 21 of POLICY.

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-mem-aes-256-xts-required refers to bit 22 of
      POLICY.

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-rapl-must-be-disabled refers to bit 23 of POLICY.

   *  sevsnpvm-policy-ciphertext-hiding-must-be-enabled refers to bit 24
      of POLICY.

   *  Bit position b greater than 24 of POLICY corresponds to extension
      16-b.

   There are 47 available bits for selection when the mandatory 1 in
   position 17 and the ABI Major.Minor values are excluded from the
   64-bit POLICY.  The PLATFORM_INFO bits are host configuration that
   are added as extensions to $$flags-map-extension starting at -49.

   $$flags-map-extension //= &(
     sevsnphost-smt-enabled: -49,
     sevsnphost-tsme-enabled: -50,
     sevsnphost-ecc-mem-reported-enabled:-51,
     sevsnphost-rapl-disabled: -52,
     sevsnphost-ciphertext-hiding-enabled: -53
     sevsnphost-reserved: -112..-49
   )

   The sevsnphost- flag extensions correspond to ATTESTATION_REPORT
   PLATFORM_INFO bit positions with the following correspondence:

   *  sevsnphost-smt-enabled refers to bit 0 of PLATFORM_INFO.

   *  sevsnphost-tsme-enabled refers to bit 1 of PLATFORM_INFO.

   *  sevsnphost-ecc-mem-reported-enabled refers to bit 2 of
      PLATFORM_INFO.

   *  sevsnphost-rapl-disabled refers to bit 3 of PLATFORM_INFO.

   *  sevsnphost-ciphertext-hiding-enabled refers to bit 4 of
      PLATFORM_INFO.

   *  Bit position b greater than 4 of PLATFORM_INFO corresponds to
      extension -49-b.

   The sevsnpvm-policy-debug-allowed flag is redundant with flags-map /
   is-debug, so either representation is valid.  The entirety of the
   value space is reserved for AMD revisions to the SEV-SNP firmware and
   corresponding ATTESTATION_REPORT API.

3.1.2.2.  Version scheme extension*

   Extend the $version-scheme type as follows

   $version-scheme /= &(sevsnpvm-familyimageid-hex: -1)

   The -1 scheme is a string representation of the two 128-bit
   identifiers in hexadecimal encoding as separated by /. The scheme
   allows for fuzzy comparison with _ as a wildcard on either side of
   the /.

   An endorsement provider MAY use a different version scheme for the
   &(version: 0) codepoint.

   For an example of a specific identifier pair, take
   h'0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' and
   h'0xbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb'.  They may be referenced as

   / version: / 0: / version-map / {
     / version: / 0: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
     / version-scheme: / 1: -1
   }

   The first identifier with any permissible second identifier may be
   referenced with

   / version: / 0: / version-map / {
     / version: / 0: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/_"
     / version-scheme: / 1: -1
   }

   The second identifier with any permissible first identifier may be
   referenced with

   / version: / 0: / version-map / {
     / version: / 0: "_/bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
     / version-scheme: / 1: -1
   }

3.1.2.3.  AMD SEV-SNP measurements

   The measurements in an ATTESTATION_REPORT are grouped into 10 mkeys
   that can refer to one or more measured values.

   The REPORT_DATA is meant for protocol use and not reference
   measurements.

   *mkey 0*: primary guest measurements

   The mval measurement-values-map may contain values for GUEST_SVN,
   MEASUREMENT, POLICY flags, FAMILY_ID and/or IMAGE_ID.

   *  The GUEST_SVN 32-bit unsigned integer may be given a reference
      value as an svn-type with a tagged-svn or tagged-min-svn encoding
      around a uint32 in an &(svn: 1): svn-type entry.

   *  The MEASUREMENT 384-bit digest may be referenced with a &(digest:
      2): [[7, MEASUREMENT]] entry.

   *  The POLICY flags may be referenced with a &(flags: 3): flags-map
      entry following the correspondence defined in Section 3.1.2.1

   *  The FAMILY_ID and IMAGE_ID may be referenced with a &(version: 0):
      version-map with the -1 as version scheme extension option as
      described in Section 3.1.2.2

   *mkey 1*: The minimum ABI guest policy

   The ATTESTATION_REPORT POLICY's lower 16 bits MAJOR_ABI and MINOR_ABI
   is expressed as version with semantic versioning scheme that has
   patch version 0.

   / measurement-values-map / {
     / version: / 0: / version-map / {
       / version: / 0: "1.55.0"
     }
   }

   The MAJOR_ABI, MINOR_ABI of the POLICY are not entirely redundant
   with Verifier policy evaluation against host's (mkey 8) &(version: 0)
   since the policy may relevant to key derivations.

   *mkey 2* The VMPL of the report.

   The VMPL is expressed as a raw value that makes use of the extended
   $raw-value-type-choice to use a uint.  To refer to VMPL 2, say

   / measurement-values-map / {
     / raw-value: / 4: 2
   }

   *mkey 3*: The REPORT_ID.

   The REPORT_ID is expressed as a &(raw-value: 4): tagged-bytes.

   *mkey 4*: The REPORT_ID_MA.

   The REPORT_ID_MA is expressed as a &(raw-value: 4): tagged-bytes.

   *mkey 5*: The ID_KEY_DIGEST.

   The ID_KEY_DIGEST is expressed as a &(raw-value: 4): tagged-bytes.

   *mkey 6*: The AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST.

   The AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST is expressed as a &(raw-value: 4): tagged-
   bytes.

   *mkey 7*: The REPORTED_TCB host measurement.

   The REPORTED_TCB is interpreted as a little-endian 64-bit unsigned
   integer and expressed as an &(svn: 1): svn-type .and svn64-type,
   where

   svn64-type = tagged-svn64 / tagged-min-svn64
   tagged-svn64 = #6.552(uint64)
   tagged-min-svn64 = #6.553(uint64)

   *mkey 8*: The current host measurements

   The CURRENT_MAJOR, CURRENT_MINOR, and CURRENT_BUILD fields are
   expressed as a version with semantic version scheme.  The version
   text is the three numbers in decimal form, separated by '.'
   (U+002E), in major, minor, build order.

   The HOSTDATA field is expressed as a raw value.  The PLATFORM_INFO
   are expressed with a flags measurement with the specified flag
   extensions.  For example,

   / measurement-values-map / {
     / version: / 0: / version-map / {
       / version: / 0: "1.55.20"
       / version-scheme / 1: 16384
     }
     / flags: / 3: / flags-map / {
       -49: true
       -52: true
     }
     / raw-value: / 4: 560(h'00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff')
   }

   *  0x9: The COMMITTED host measurements for COMMITTED_BUILD,
      CURRENT_MAJOR, CURRENT_MINOR, and COMMITTED_TCB.

   The COMMITTED_MAJOR, COMMITTED_MINOR, and COMMITTED_BUILD fields are
   expressed as a version with semantic version scheme.  The version
   text is the three numbers in decimal form, separated by '.'
   (U+002E), in major, minor, build order.

   The COMMITTED_TCB is interpreted as a little-endian 64-bit unsigned
   integer and expressed as an &(svn: 1): svn-type .and svn64-type.  For
   example, suppose the committed TCB has microcode SVN 209, SNP
   firmware version 22, TEE version 0, and bootloader version 3

   / measurement-values-map / {
     / version: / 0: / version-map / {
       / version: / 0: "1.55.20"
       / version-scheme: / 16384
     }
     / svn: / 1: 552(0xd116000000000003)
   }

   *  0xa: The LAUNCH_TCB host measurement.

   The LAUNCH_TCB is interpreted as a little-endian 64-bit unsigned
   integer and expressed as an &(svn: 1): svn-type .and svn64-type.

3.1.3.  AMD SEV-SNP Evidence Translation

   The ATTESTATION_REPORT Evidence is converted into a CoRIM internal
   representation ECT for the ae relation using the rules in this
   section.

3.1.3.1.  environment

   If SIGNING_KEY is 0

   *  The environment-map / class / class-id field SHALL be set to
      37(h'd05e6d1b9f464ae2a610ce3e6ee7e153').

   *  The environment-map / instance field

      -  MAY be 560(CHIP_ID) only if MASK_CHIP_KEY is 0, or

      -  MAY be 560(hwid) where hwid is from the VCEK certificate
         extension value of 1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.1.4.

   If SIGNING_KEY is 1

   *  The environment-map / class / class-id field SHALL be set to
      37(h'89a7a1f0e7044faaacbd81c86df8a961').

   *  The environment-map / instance field SHALL be 560(CSP_ID).

3.1.3.2.  element-list

   Different fields of the attestation report correspond to different
   element-ids that correspond to their mkey value of a CoMID.

   The translation makes use of the following metafunctions:

   *  The function hex(bstr) represents the hexadecimal string encoding
      of a byte string.

   *  The function dec(b) represents a byte in its decimal string
      rendering.

   *  The function leuint(bstr) represents the translation of a byte
      string into a CBOR uint using a little-endian interpretation.

   Juxtaposition of expressions with string literals is interpreted with
   string concatenation.

   Note: A value of 0 is not treated the same as unset given the
   semantics for matching flags-map.

   *  / element-id: / 0, the guest data element-claims

      -  The &(version: 0) codepoint MAY be unset if the report does not
         contain ID block data, otherwise the &(version: 0) codepoint
         SHALL be set to / version-map / { / version: / 0: vstr /
         version-scheme: / 1: -1 } with version string vstr constructed
         as hex(FAMILY_ID) '/' hex(IMAGE_ID).

      -  The &(svn: 1) codepoint MAY be unset if the report does not
         contain ID block data, otherwise the &(svn: 1) codepoint SHALL
         be set to 552(leuint(GUEST_SVN)).

      -  The &(digests: 2) codepoint SHALL be set to [ / digest / [ /
         alg: / 7, / val: / MEASUREMENT ] ].  The algorithm assignment
         is from [IANA.named-information] for SHA384.

      -  The &(flags: 3) / flags-map / is-confidentiality-protected
         codepoint MAY be set to true.

      -  The &(flags: 3) / flags-map / is-integrity-protected codepoint
         MAY be set to true.

      -  The &(flags: 3) / flags-map / is-replay-protected codepoint MAY
         be set to true.

      -  The &(flags: 3) / flags-map / is-debug codepoint SHALL be set
         to the truth value of bit 19 of POLICY.

      -  The flags-map extensions for POLICY are assigned their truth
         values following the correspondence in Section 3.1.2.1.

   *  / element-id: / 1, guest policy minimum firmware element-claims

      -  The &(version: 0) SHALL be set to / version-map / { / version:
         /: dec(POLICY[15:8]) '.' dec(POLICY[7:0]) '.0' , / version-
         scheme: / 16384 }.

   *  / element-id: 2 / the report privilege level element-claims

      -  The &(raw-value: 5) codepoint SHALL be set to VMPL as a uint.

   *  / element-id: 3 / the per-launch REPORT_ID element-claims

      -  The &(raw-value: 5) codepoint SHALL be set to 560(REPORT_ID).

   *  / element-id: 4 / the migration agent–assigned REPORT_ID_MA
      element-claims

      -  The &(raw-value: 5) codepoint SHALL be set to 560(REPORT_ID_MA)
         if nonzero.

   *  / element-id: 5 / the ID block–signing key digest ID_KEY_DIGEST
      element-claims

      -  The &(raw-value: 5) codepoint SHALL be set to
         560(ID_KEY_DIGEST) if nonzero.

   *  / element-id: 6 / the ID block–signing key's certifying key digest
      AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST element-claims

      -  The &(raw-value: 5) codepoint SHALL be set to
         560(AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST) if nonzero.

   *  / element-id: 7 / the REPORTED_TCB element-claims

      -  The &(svn: 1) codepoint SHALL be set to
         552(leuint(REPORTED_TCB)).

   *  / element-id: 8 / the current host info element-claims

      -  The &(version: 0) codepoint SHALL be set to / version-map / { /
         version: 0 / vstr / version-scheme: / 1: 16384 } with version
         string vstr constructed as dec(CURRENT_MAJOR) '.'
         dec(CURRENT_MINOR) '.' dec(CURRENT_BUILD).

      -  The &(flags: 3) / flags-map extensions for PLATFORM_INFO SHALL
         be assign their truth values following the correspondence is
         Section 3.1.2.1.

      -  The &(raw-value: 5) codepoint SHALL be set to 560(HOSTDATA) and
         MAY be omitted if all zeros.

   *  / element-id: 9 / the committed host info element-claims

      -  The &(svn: 1) codepoint SHALL be set to
         552(leuint(COMMITTED_TCB)).

   *  / element-id: 4 / the TCB at launch element-claims

      -  The &(svn: 1) codepoint SHALL be set to
         552(leuint(LAUNCH_TCB)).

   *  / element-id: 10 / the guest policy's minimum SEV-SNP ABI version
      that launch compares against CURRENT_MAJOR and CURRENT_MINOR.

      -  The &(version: 0) codepoint SHALL be set to / version-map / { /
         version: / 0: vstr / version-scheme: / 1: 16384 } with version
         string vstr constructed as dec(MAJOR_ABI) '.' dec(MINOR_ABI)
         '.0'.

3.1.3.3.  authority

   The authority SHALL be set to an array of the tagged-pkix-asn1der-
   cert-type forms of the VEK certificate for the ATTESTATION_REPORT
   signing key, the intermediate key, and the AMD root key for the
   product line.

   The Verifier MAY add additional encodings of these keys.

3.1.3.4.  cmtype

   The cmtype SHALL be evidence: 2.

3.1.3.5.  profile

   The profile SHALL be set to this profile's identifier,
   32("http://amd.com/please-permalink-me")

3.1.3.6.  Optional: ID block as reference value

   If an ID block is provided at VM launch, it is authenticated by an ID
   key.  The ID block authentication is checked by the AMD-SP firmware.
   The firmware will only launch the VM if the authenticated policy
   matches.  The firmware indicates that the authentication passed by
   populating fields of the attestation report to bind the evidence to
   the authentication key(s) ID_KEY_DIGEST and/or AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST.
   The ID block authentication as reference value SHALL NOT be retained
   by the Verifier to apply to another appraisal session.  The reference
   value qualification is meant to be considered valid only for the
   duration of the appraisal session.

   The Verifier MAY allocate an rv for an addition ECT to represent the
   authentication at SNP_LAUNCH_FINISH.

   *  The environment SHALL be equal to the environment of the evidence
      ECT.

   *  The element-list SHALL contain two element-map entries

      -  The first element-map SHALL set element-id to 0 and the
         element-claims to a copy of the evidence claims for element-id:
         0.

      -  The second element-map SHALL set element-id to 1 and the
         element-claims to a copy of the evidence claims for element-id:
         1.

   *  The authority SHALL be an array containing 32780(ID_KEY_DIGEST)
      and 32780(AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST) if nonzero.  The Verifier MAY add
      more encodings of the same keys.

   *  The cmtype SHALL be set to reference-values: 0

   *  The profile SHALL be set to this profile's identifier,
      32("http://amd.com/please-permalink-me").

4.  TCG considerations

   The Trusted Computing Group has standardized the PCClient Platform
   Firmware Profile to specify expected TPM event log processing.  Since
   AMD SEV-SNP launch measurements are of virtual firmware, they can
   supplement the EV_POST_CODE2 event measured into PCR0 for the
   EV_EFI_PLATFORM_FIRMWARE_BLOB2 since the bits of the firmware are
   more specific than embedded firmware version strings.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New CBOR Tags

   IANA is requested to allocate the following tags in the "CBOR Tags"
   registry [IANA.cbor-tags].

          +=======+===========+====================+===========+
          | Tag   | Data Item | Semantics          | Reference |
          +=======+===========+====================+===========+
          | 32780 | bytes     | A digest of an AMD | RFCthis   |
          |       |           | public key format. |           |
          +-------+-----------+--------------------+-----------+

                         Table 1: Added CBOR tags

5.2.  New media types

5.2.1.  application/vnd.amd.sev.snp.attestation-report

   An octet-stream that is expected to be interpreted as an AMD SEV-SNP
   ATTESTATION_REPORT.

5.2.2.  application/vnd.amd.ghcb.guid-table

   An octet-stream that follows the [GHCB]'s GUID table ABI, which is
   the same as the [SVSM] service manifest ABI, recounted here.  A GUID
   table is a header followed by an octet-stream body.  The header is a
   sequence of entries described in Table 2 terminated by an all zero
   entry.  After the all zero entry are the bytes that the header
   entries index into.

          +===========+========+===============================+
          | Type      | Name   | Description                   |
          +===========+========+===============================+
          | UUID      | GUID   | An [RFC4122] byte format UUID |
          +-----------+--------+-------------------------------+
          | LE_UINT32 | Offset | A little-endian offset into   |
          |           |        | the the GUID table            |
          +-----------+--------+-------------------------------+
          | LE_UINT32 | Length | A little-endian byte length   |
          |           |        | of the span                   |
          +-----------+--------+-------------------------------+

                Table 2: guid_table_entry type description

   Note that an offset is from the start of the octet-stream, and not
   from the start of the octets following the zero entry of the header.
   A header entry is valid if its Offset+Length is less than or equal to
   the size of the entire GUID table.
