1.  Introduction

   This profile describes the extensions and restrictions placed on
   Reference Values, Endorsements, and Evidence that support the
   attestation capabilities of AMD products that provide Securet
   Encrypted Virtualization with Secure Nested Pages (SEV-SNP).

   CoRIM ([I-D.ietf-rats-corim]) defines a baseline CDDL for Reference
   Values and Endorsements that this profile extends.  Some measurement
   types of the baseline CDDL are not used in this profile.  The AMD
   SEV-SNP attestation report byte format is specified by AMD.  The
   profile defines a transformation from the AMD byte format into a
   CoMID representation for use in appraisal.

   This profile is meant for expressing reference values and
   endorsements of specific environments.  It is not meant to encode
   complex policy decisions about the acceptability of measurements.
   The accepted claim set construction (ACS) this profile enables does
   lay a foundation for policy engines that enable further evaluation
   over complete ACS constructions.

   This profile extends the flags-map to represent the guest policy and
   host platform info that are unique to AMD SEV-SNP.  The profile
   extends the $crypto-key-type-choice to represent the SHA-384 digest
   of a key in AMD format from Appendix: Digital Signatures of
   [SEV-SNP.API].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC2119 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-corim] and Section 4 of [RFC9334].  The syntax of data
   descriptions is CDDL as specified in [RFC8610].  Fields of the AMD
   SEV-SNP ATTESTATION_REPORT are referred to by their assigned names in
   [SEV-SNP.API].

3.  AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Reports

   The AMD SEV-SNP attestation scheme in [SEV-SNP.API] contains
   measurements of security-relevant configuration of the host
   environment and the launch configuration of a SEV-SNP VM.  This draft
   documents the normative representation of attestation report Evidence
   as a CoRIM profile.

   AMD-SP: AMD Secure Processor.  A separate core that provides the
   confidentiality and integrity properties of AMD SEV-SNP.  The
   function that is relevant to this document is its construction of
   signed virtual machine attestation reports.

   [VCEK]: Versioned Chip Endorsement Key.  A key for signing the SEV-
   SNP Attestation Report.  The key is derived from a unique device
   secret as well as the security patch levels of relevant host
   components.

   [VLEK]: Version Loaded Endorsement Key.  An alternative SEV-SNP
   Attestation Report signing key that is derived from a secret shared
   between AMD and a Cloud Service Provider.  The key is encrypted with
   a per-device per-version wrapping key that is then decrypted and
   stored by the AMD-SP.

   VEK: Either a VCEK or VLEK.

3.1.  AMD SEV-SNP CoRIM Profile

   AMD SEV-SNP launch endorsements are carried in one or more CoMIDs
   inside a CoRIM.

   The profile attribute in the CoRIM MUST be present and MUST have a
   single entry set to the URI http://amd.com/please-permalink-me as
   shown in Figure 1.

   / corim-map / {
     / corim.profile / 3: [
       32("http://amd.com/please-permalink-me")
     ]
     / ... /
   }

       Figure 1: SEV-SNP attestation profile version 1, CoRIM profile

3.1.1.  AMD SEV-SNP Target Environment

   The ATTESTATION_REPORT structure as understood in the RATS
   Architecture [RFC9334] is a signed collection of Claims that
   constitute Evidence about the Target Environment.  The Attester for
   the ATTESTATION_REPORT is specialized hardware that will only run
   AMD-signed firmware.

   The instance identifier can be argued as any of REPORT_ID,
   REPORT_ID_MA when non-zero, CHIP_ID (for VCEK), or CSP_ID (for VLEK).
   Given that REPORT_ID and REPORT_ID_MA are more ephemeral measured
   values and not the instance of the AMD-SP as the attesting
   environment, they are relegated to measurements.  Any endorsement of
   VM instances specific to either the REPORT_ID or REPORT_ID_MA values
   SHOULD use a conditional endorsement triple.

   The different notions of identity induce different classes of
   attestation to identify target environments.  The different classes
   of attestation are

   *  By chip: The environment-map / instance is 560(CHIP_ID).

   *  By CSP: The environment-map / instance is 560(CSP_ID).

   The CSP_ID is only evident from the VLEK certificate, which uses the
   ASN.1 IA5String encoding.  For the tagged-bytes representation,
   however, the CSP_ID SHALL be the UTF-8 encoding of the text string.

   The class-id for the Target Environment measured by the AMD-SP is a
   tagged UUID that corresponds to the attestation class:

   *  By chip: d05e6d1b-9f46-4ae2-a610-ce3e6ee7e153

   *  By CSP: 89a7a1f0-e704-4faa-acbd-81c86df8a961

   TODO: AMD to assign OIDs for the above classes, e.g.,
   #6.111(1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.2.1) and #6.111(1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.2.2).

   The &(model: 2) field of the class-map is specific to the product
   name of the chip as determined by the family/model (not stepping)
   value.  The text for model MUST be the product_name specified in the
   [VCEK] specification, e.g., "Milan" or "Genoa".

   The rest of the class-map MUST remain empty, since class is compared
   for deterministic CBOR binary encoding equality.

   The group is free for a CoRIM issuer to assign.

   If the SIGNING_KEY bit of the attestation report is 1 indicating VLEK
   use, then the class-id MUST NOT be by chip.

   / environment-map / {
     / class-map / {
       / class-id: / 0 => #6.111(1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.2.1)
     }
     / instance: / 1 => #6.560(CHIP_ID)
   }

3.1.2.  AMD SEV-SNP Attestation Report measurements

   The fields of an attestation report are named by mkey numbers that
   map to appropriate measurement-values-map values.  This profile
   defines no new measurement-values-map extensions for the
   $$measurement-values-map-extensions socket.  Flag-like values are
   delegated to the raw-value and raw-value-mask measurement values.

3.1.2.1.  AMD SEV-SNP measurements

   The measurements in an ATTESTATION_REPORT are each assigned an mkey
   value and the field value is translated to an appropriate
   measurement-values-map entry.  The convention for mkey value
   assignment is to sequential ordering when there are no reserved bits.
   The mkey following a reserved bit is the bit position in the report
   of the start of the value.  The R[lo:hi] notation will reference the
   attestation report byte slice from offset lo inclusive to hi
   exclusive.  The leuint(slice) function translates a byte string in
   little endian to its uint representation.

3.1.3.  AMD SEV-SNP Evidence Translation to reference-triple-record

   The ATTESTATION_REPORT Evidence is converted into a CoRIM internal
   representation given the canonical translation from a reference-
   triple-record as evidence conceptual message.

3.1.3.1.  environment

   If SIGNING_KEY is 0

   *  The environment-map / class / class-id field SHALL be set to
      37(h'd05e6d1b9f464ae2a610ce3e6ee7e153').

   *  The environment-map / instance field

      -  MAY be 560(CHIP_ID) only if MASK_CHIP_KEY is 0, or

      -  MAY be 560(hwid) where hwid is from the VCEK certificate
         extension value of 1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.1.4.

   If SIGNING_KEY is 1

   *  The environment-map / class / class-id field SHALL be set to
      37(h'89a7a1f0e7044faaacbd81c86df8a961').

   *  The environment-map / instance field SHALL be 560(CSP_ID).

3.1.3.2.  measurement-map

   The translation makes use of the following metafunctions:

   *  The function dec(b) represents a byte in its decimal string
      rendering.

   Juxtaposition of expressions with string literals is interpreted with
   string concatenation.

   Note: A value of 0 is not treated the same as unset given the
   semantics for matching flags-map.

   *no mkey*:

   The &(flags: 3) codepoint SHALL be set to a flags-map with the
   following construction:

   *  is-confidentiality-protected MAY be set to true.

   *mkey 647*: REPORTED_TCB The codepoint &(svn: 1) SHALL be set to
   552(reported_tcb) where reported_tcb is REPORTED_TCB (R[0x180:0x188])
   translated to uint from its little-endian representation.

   *mkey 648*: CPUID_FAM_ID.  The codepoint &(raw-value: 4) SHALL be set
   to 560(R[0x188:0x189]) only if VERSION (little endian R[0x000:0x004])
   is at least 3.

   *mkey 649*: CPUID_MOD_ID.  The codepoint &(raw-value: 4) SHALL be set

   representation.

   *mkey 3330*: CurrentVersion.  The &(version: 0) codepoint SHALL be
   set to

   / version-map / {
     / version: 0 / vstr
     / version-scheme: / 1: 16384
   }

   The version string vstr is constructed as dec(R[0x1EA]) '.'
   dec(R[0x1E9]) '.' dec(R[0x1E8]).

   *mkey 3936*: CommittedVersion.  The &(version: 0) codepoint SHALL be
   set to

   / version-map / {
     / version: 0 / vstr
     / version-scheme: / 1: 16384
   }

   The version string vstr is constructed as dec(R[0x1EE]) '.'
   dec(R[0x1ED]) '.' dec(R[0x1EC]).

   *mkey 3968*: LAUNCH_TCB.  The codepoint &(svn: 1) SHALL be set to
   552(launch_tcb) where launch_tcb is LAUNCH_TCB (R[0x1F0:0x1F8])
   translated to uint from its little-endian representation.

3.1.3.3.  cmtype

   The cmtype SHALL be evidence: 2.

3.1.3.4.  Optional: ID block as reference value

   If an ID block is provided at VM launch, it is authenticated by an ID
   key.  The ID block authentication is checked by the AMD-SP firmware.
   The firmware will only launch the VM if the authenticated policy
   matches.  The firmware indicates that the authentication passed by
   populating fields of the attestation report to bind the evidence to
   the authentication key(s) ID_KEY_DIGEST and/or AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST.
   The ID block authentication as reference value SHALL NOT be retained
   by the Verifier to apply to another appraisal session.  The reference
   value qualification is meant to be considered valid only for the
   duration of the appraisal session.

   The Verifier MAY allocate an rv for an addition ECT to represent the
   authentication at SNP_LAUNCH_FINISH.

   *  The environment SHALL be equal to the environment of the evidence
      ECT.

   *  The element-list SHALL contain two element-map entries

      -  The first element-map SHALL set element-id to 0 and the
         element-claims to a copy of the evidence claims for element-id:
         0.

      -  The second element-map SHALL set element-id to 1 and the
         element-claims to a copy of the evidence claims for element-id:
         1.

   *  The authority SHALL be an array containing 32780(ID_KEY_DIGEST)
      and 32780(AUTHOR_KEY_DIGEST) if nonzero.  The Verifier MAY add
      more encodings of the same keys.

   *  The cmtype SHALL be set to reference-values: 0

3.1.3.5.  VEK Certificate attest-key-triple-record

   Each VEK Certificate from AMD's Key Distribution Service (KDS)
   contains extensions that associate the key to its target environment.
   There is no condition on REPORTED_TCB to form this association, since
   the keys will only ever verify evidence that corresponds the the
   REPORTED_TCB they were derived from.

   To allow for certificates to be reissued, the keys associated to an
   environment use only the SubjectPublicKeyInfo.  For consistent
   comparison, the $crypto-key-type-choice encoding is a #6.557-tagged
   SHA256 digest (alg: 1) of the ASN.1 encoding as defined in [RFC5280].
   Let vcek_pk represent the tagged key identifier of the VCEK public
   key.

   A [VCEK] certificate may be interpreted with hwid as the octet-string
   value from X.509 extension 1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.1.4 as

   [ / environment-map / {
       &(class: 0): / class-map / {
         &(class-id: 0): 37(h'd05e6d1b9f464ae2a610ce3e6ee7e153'),
         &(model: 2): "Genoa"
       },
       &(instance: 2): 560(hwid)
     },
     [ vcek_pk ]
   ]

   Note: KDS may not encode the hwid with the octet string type tag 0x04
   and length information (definite, short, 64) 0x40 of the x.509
   extension value.  If the length is 64 bytes, then that is the exact
   hwid.

   Let vlek_pk be the encoded VLEK public key.  A [VLEK] certificate
   SHALL be associated with an environment with a "by CSP" class-id and
   instance value as a tagged-bytes of the UTF-8 encoded csp_id string
   from X.509 extension 1.3.6.1.4.1.3704.1.5 as

   [ / environment-map / {
       &(class: 0): / class-map / {
         &(class-id: 0): 37(h'89a7a1f0e7044faaacbd81c86df8a961'),

   It is expected that the Verifier will require or admit a trust anchor
   that associates the AMD root key and AMD SEV key certificates for a
   product_name (from KDS endpoint vcek/v1/{product_name}/cert_chain or
   vlek/v1/{product_name}/cert_chain) with the appropriate environment
   class in order to validate the attestation key certificates.  If
   using a CoTS [I-D.ietf-rats-concise-ta-stores] tag for trust anchor
   specification, an appropriate purpose for verifying a VEK cerificate
   is "eat".

4.  TCG considerations

   The Trusted Computing Group has standardized the PCClient Platform
   Firmware Profile to specify expected TPM event log processing.  Since
   AMD SEV-SNP launch measurements are of virtual firmware, they can
   supplement the EV_POST_CODE2 event measured into PCR0 for the
   EV_EFI_PLATFORM_FIRMWARE_BLOB2 since the bits of the firmware are
   more specific than embedded firmware version strings.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New CBOR Tags

   IANA is requested to allocate the following tags in the "CBOR Tags"
   registry [IANA.cbor-tags].

          +=======+===========+====================+===========+
          | Tag   | Data Item | Semantics          | Reference |
          +=======+===========+====================+===========+
          | 32780 | bytes     | A digest of an AMD | RFCthis   |
          |       |           | public key format. |           |
          +-------+-----------+--------------------+-----------+

                         Table 1: Added CBOR tags

5.2.  New media types

5.2.1.  application/vnd.amd.sev-snp.attestation-report

   A byte string that is expected to be interpreted as an AMD SEV-SNP
   ATTESTATION_REPORT.

5.2.2.  application/vnd.amd.ghcb.guid-table

   An byte string that follows the [GHCB]'s GUID table ABI, which is the
   same as the [SVSM] service manifest ABI, recounted here.  A GUID
   table is a header followed by an byte string body.  The header is a
   sequence of entries described in Table 2 terminated by an all zero
   entry.  After the all zero entry are the bytes that the header
   entries index into.

        +===========+========+===================================+
        | Type      | Name   | Description                       |
        +===========+========+===================================+
        | UUID      | GUID   | An [RFC4122] byte format UUID     |
        +-----------+--------+-----------------------------------+
        | LE_UINT32 | Offset | An offset into the the GUID table |
        +-----------+--------+-----------------------------------+
        | LE_UINT32 | Length | A byte length of the span         |
        +-----------+--------+-----------------------------------+

                Table 2: guid_table_entry type description

   An LE_UINT32 is a 4 byte byte string that represents a nonnegative
   integer in little-endian order.

   Note that an offset is from the start of the byte string, and not
   from the start of the octets following the zero entry of the header.
   A header entry is valid if its Offset+Length is less than or equal to
   the size of the entire GUID table.

5.3.  New CoAP Content-Formats entries

   The content types application/vnd.amd.sev-snp.attestation-
   reportandapplication/vnd.amd.ghcb.guid-tableneed Content-Formats IDs
   to be used in the EATmeasurements` claim.  Requesting 10572 and 10573
   respectively.
